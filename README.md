#Oh Snap!

One of the proposed specs for HTML6 introduces flexibility in tags based entirely on the attributes associated with the tag provided. This project intends to explore this proposed spec and provide functionality for creating html/template files from a single tag based on attributes, content, and parent location.

* No need to specify DOCTYPE, if you need it, we've got you covered
* The same goes for content type
* The same goes for link rel and script type
* Hard Returns are not preserved

As of this time, the library parses tags in the head of complete .snap documents (no templates yet).
